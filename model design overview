employ graph attention network (GAT) for compounds and CNN for proteins

design bi-directional attention (attention of atoms to protein and amino acid to compound) neural network architecture 

Finally, the integrated vector representations of compoundâ€“protein pair are fed into the classifier

the training objective is to minimize the loss function (Cross-Entropy Loss in CPI prediction task and Mean Square Error in affinity prediction task)

The optimizer of our model is Adam
